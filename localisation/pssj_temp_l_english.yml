 pssj.1.t: "Welcome to the Broken World mod"
 pssj.1.desc: "The long-awaited "Broken World" mod is finally released! However, it is currently in a very early version—only the original save configuration has been restored. A lot of work is still needed to optimize the gameplay experience, but it is playable. Compared to the save version, each country can take different paths in every playthrough, which is also the reason why I developed it into a mod. The background story of this mod has not yet been fully fleshed out, but it is confirmed that all original tags will appear on the map. I have fine-tuned the content of some tags, but more adaptation work will require additional help to complete."
 pssj.1.a: "So, is this like... playing Europa Universalis in HoI4?"
